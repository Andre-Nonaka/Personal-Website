			<h3>Research internship at Sunnybrook Research Institute</h3>
			<p>As an intern at the Dadbdoub labratory at Sunnybrook Research institute I worked alongside Allain Dabdoub and PH.D graduate students to find a solution to individuals who suffer from disabling hearing loss using a neuronal reprogramming approach. Ultimately, the result of the research could propose gene therapy and neuronal reprogramming as a novel approach for treatement of hearing loss.</p>

			<p>I assembled computers and organized electrical components in a logical and neat fashion. Also, as a tutor I conducted tutoring sessions for students in Science/Math courses. I assesed their performance by reviewing their past test scores and endeavoured to keep them on track to exceed previous marks. As result, this propelled academic success of dozens of students boosting GPA's/test scores to new bests. </p><a class="button" href="https://www.dpcdsb.org/leger" target="">Check it out</a>
